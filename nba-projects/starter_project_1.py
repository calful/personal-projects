# Here we access the leagueleaders module through endpoints & assign the class to "data"
data = endpoints.leagueleaders.LeagueLeaders() 

# Our "data" variable now has built in functions such as creating a dataframe for our data
df = data.league_leaders.get_data_frame()

# take a sneak peak at the first 5 rows
df.head()

# First we need to get per game stats.
# We divide each variable by games played (GP) to get per game average
x, y = df.FGA/df.GP, df.PTS/df.GP 

# we have to reshape our array from 1d to 2d. 
# The proper shaped array is an input requirement for the linear model
# reshaping is usually an issue when using 1 x variable
x = np.array(x).reshape(-1,1)     
y = np.array(y).reshape(-1,1)

# Get our r2 value and round it to 2 decimals. How much variance is explained?
# Get our predicted y values for x

# Now, lets make a plot with matplot lib using a iterative approach (which is easy to read)

# Finally, let's save an image called 'graph.png'. 
# We'll set the dpi (dots per inch) to 300, so we have a nice looking picture.
